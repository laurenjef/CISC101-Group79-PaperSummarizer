### Module 6 — Word Count Expansion or Compression

Adjust the length of the output depending on the user’s request

If the user requests shorter/lower word count answer: compress via abstraction and concept grouping to requested word count
If the user requests longer/higher word count sections: elaborate via details drawn from text pool 

If no length is specified: proceed normally unclear
